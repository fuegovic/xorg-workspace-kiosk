# Notes:
# - Workspace numbers can be 0-9 (or higher if your system supports it)
# - You don't need to define all workspaces, only the ones you want to use
# - Workspaces will be processed in numerical order
# - For app type, use full absolute paths
# - For chromium/firefox, make sure to include https:// in URLs
